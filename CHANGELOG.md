- [#51](https://github.com/redoubt-cysec/provenance-template/pull/51) - Three quick wins (checksums, metadata, dependency pinning)

### Changed
- Verification increased from 5/14 (36%) to 14/14 (100%)
- Enhanced attestation parsing to support multiple formats
- Improved error messages and verification output

### Migration Notes
- For full verification, install: `cosign`, `gh`, `osv-scanner`
- Set `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` environment variable when running verify command
