# dev-setup.sh: Comprehensive development environment setup script
#
# This script ensures a consistent and complete development environment is set up
# with a single command. It is idempotent and can be run safely multiple times.

set -e # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

# --- Helper Functions ---

# Print a message in a consistent format
info() {
    echo -e "\033[34m[INFO]\033[0m $1"
}

# Print a success message
success() {
    echo -e "\033[32m[SUCCESS]\033[0m $1"
}

# Print a warning message
warning() {
    echo -e "\033[33m[WARNING]\033[0m $1"
}

# Check if a command exists
command_exists() {
    command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
