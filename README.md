## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Repository

Click **"Use this template"** on GitHub to create your own repository.

### 2. Install Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.11 or higher
python --version

# Install uv (fast Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Optional: Install just (command runner)
brew install just  # macOS
# or: cargo install just
```

### 3. Customize the Template

**Option A: Interactive Wizard (Recommended)**

Run the initialization wizard to customize the template for your project:

```bash
just init
```

Or directly:
```bash
python3 scripts/init-template.py
```

The wizard will interactively prompt you for:
- Package name (Python module)
- CLI command name
- GitHub repository owner/name
- Project metadata (description, author)
- GitHub secrets for distribution platforms (optional)

It's **idempotent** - safe to run multiple times and will detect your current configuration.

**Option B: Manual Setup**

Alternatively, use the shell script to replace placeholder values:

```bash
./scripts/setup_local_config.sh
```

This replaces `redoubt-cysec/provenance-demo` with your repository details throughout the codebase.

### 3a. Set Up Development Environment

After customizing the template, set up your development environment:

```bash
just dev-setup
```

This will:
- Install development tools (uv, pre-commit)
- Create virtual environment
- Install dependencies
- Set up pre-commit hooks

**Already have tools installed?** Use `just install` to only install the package in development mode.

### 4. Pin GitHub Actions

For maximum supply chain security, pin all GitHub Actions to specific commit SHAs:

```bash
# See the guide for detailed instructions
cat docs/security/GITHUB-ACTION-PINS.md
```

Replace all `<PINNED_SHA>` placeholders in `.github/workflows/*.yml` files.

### 5. Build and Test

```bash
# Using just (recommended)
just build
just test
just verify

# Or using uv directly
uv build
uv run pytest tests/ -v
./dist/provenance-demo.pyz --version
./dist/provenance-demo.pyz verify
```

### 6. Add Your Application Code

Now that the template is configured, add your application logic:

1. **Add Your Code:** Replace `src/demo_cli/` with your application logic
2. **Update Tests:** Modify `tests/` to test your code
3. **Update Documentation:** Customize docs and examples for your project
4. **Configure Secrets:** (Optional) The `just init` wizard can set these up, or see [Platform Status](docs/distribution/PLATFORM-STATUS.md)

See the [Developer Guide](docs/contributing/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md) for detailed development instructions.

### 7. Release

```bash
# Tag a release
git tag v1.0.0 -m "First release"
git push origin v1.0.0

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# - Build deterministic artifacts
# - Sign with Sigstore/cosign
# - Generate attestations and SBOM
# - Run security scans
# - Create GitHub Release
# - (Optional) Publish to distribution platforms
```

## Verification

All releases include comprehensive security verification with **14 automated checks**:

```bash
# Download a release
gh release download v0.0.1-alpha.40 --repo redoubt-cysec/provenance-template

# Run verification (14/14 checks)
GITHUB_REPOSITORY=redoubt-cysec/provenance-template \
  python3 provenance-demo.pyz verify
```

**Example Output:**

```

## Example Usage

The template includes a demo CLI to show how everything works:

```bash
# Build the demo
just build

# Run the demo
./dist/provenance-demo.pyz --version
./dist/provenance-demo.pyz hello "World"
./dist/provenance-demo.pyz verify
```

Replace the demo code in `src/demo_cli/` with your own application.
