## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your Repository

Click **"Use this template"** on GitHub to create your own repository.

### 2. Install Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.11 or higher
python --version

# Install uv (fast Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Optional: Install just (command runner)
brew install just  # macOS
# or: cargo install just
```

### 3. Configure the Template

Run the setup script to replace placeholder values:

```bash
./scripts/setup_local_config.sh
```

This replaces `redoubt-cysec/provenance-demo` with your repository details throughout the codebase.

### 4. Pin GitHub Actions

For maximum supply chain security, pin all GitHub Actions to specific commit SHAs:

```bash
# See the guide for detailed instructions
cat docs/security/GITHUB-ACTION-PINS.md
```

Replace all `<PINNED_SHA>` placeholders in `.github/workflows/*.yml` files.

### 5. Build and Test

```bash
# Using just (recommended)
just build
just test
just verify

# Or using uv directly
uv build
uv run pytest tests/ -v
./dist/provenance-demo.pyz --version
./dist/provenance-demo.pyz verify
```

### 6. Customize for Your Project

1. **Rename the CLI:** Update `pyproject.toml` with your package name and CLI command
2. **Add Your Code:** Replace `src/demo_cli/` with your application logic
3. **Update Documentation:** Modify README, docs, and examples
4. **Configure Secrets:** (Optional) Add distribution secrets for Homebrew, Winget, etc.

See the [Developer Guide](docs/contributing/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md) for detailed customization instructions.

### 7. Release

```bash
# Tag a release
git tag v1.0.0 -m "First release"
git push origin v1.0.0

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# - Build deterministic artifacts
# - Sign with Sigstore/cosign
# - Generate attestations and SBOM
# - Run security scans
# - Create GitHub Release
# - (Optional) Publish to distribution platforms
```

## Verification

All releases include cryptographic signatures and attestations. Verify them with:

```bash
# Verify GitHub attestations
gh attestation verify provenance-demo.pyz \
  --owner redoubt-cysec

# Verify with built-in command
./provenance-demo.pyz verify

# Rebuild from source and compare hashes
gh workflow run rebuilder.yml
```

See [SUPPLY-CHAIN.md](docs/security/SUPPLY-CHAIN.md) for complete verification instructions.

## Example Usage

The template includes a demo CLI to show how everything works:

```bash
# Build the demo
just build

# Run the demo
./dist/provenance-demo.pyz --version
./dist/provenance-demo.pyz hello "World"
./dist/provenance-demo.pyz verify
```

Replace the demo code in `src/demo_cli/` with your own application.
